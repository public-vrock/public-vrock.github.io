Each post automatically takes the first block of text, from the beginning of the content to the first occurrence of excerpt_separator, and sets it in the post’s data hash. Take the above example of an index of posts. Perhaps you want to include a little hint about the post’s content by adding the first paragraph of each of your posts:


<!--more-->

{% highlight ruby %}
def show
  @widget = Widget(params[:id])
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html # show.html.erb
    format.json { render json: @widget }
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
